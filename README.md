# Backend infrastructure (TripPlannerAPI)
## Overview
The backend is a **Spring Boot application** that serves the Trip Planner Web App, providing CRUD operations for trip data.

<img src="docs/backend-diagram.png" alt="trip-planner-backend-api-infra">

## Key Attributes

**Maintainability**
- Runs as **Docker containers on AWS Fargate**, removing the need to manage EC2 instances.
- Easy to scale and maintain.

**Reliability**
- **PostgreSQL via AWS RDS** with automated backups, patching, and high availability.

**Scalability**
- ECS Service manages container count automatically as traffic grows.

**Security**
- ECS tasks and RDS run in **private subnets** inside a dedicated VPC.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** routes traffic from public to private subnets.
- **AWS WAF** is tied to the ALB to protect against common web attacks.
- Secrets are stored securely in **AWS Secrets Manager**.

**Monitoring**
- ECS logs are streamed to **AWS CloudWatch Logs** for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **AWS CloudWatch Alarms + SNS** are set up to monitor :
  - ECS service :
     - Alert when ECS CPU utilization exceeds 90% 
     - Alert when ECS Memory utilization exceeds 90%
     - Alert when ECS service has unhealthy tasks
  - RDS database :
     - Alert when RDS free storage space is low
     - Alert when DB has CPU utilization of 0% for 5 minutes - RDS is potentially down
  - ALB :
     - ALB target group has unhealthy hosts
     - Alert when ALB has too many 5xx errors
     - Alert when ALB has high latency (over 2 seconds)

## üîç Gotchas -  Lessons learned ( sometimes the hard way...)
### RDS - Database
- *RDS Password Surprise:* Always provide a strong, non-trivial password to AWS RDS ‚Äî even for testing. A weak password like postgres may be silently rejected by AWS, and RDS will auto-generate a new password, saving it in AWS Secrets Manager. Check this under DB Instance > Configuration > Master credentials ARN.
    - In this case you may manually update secrets password provided to the ECS Service to align with the AWS RDS generated password.
- *RDS Subnet Requirement:* AWS RDS in production mode requires at least two subnets in different availability zones to enable high availability. If you only provide one, deployment will fail silently or behave unexpectedly.
- *Database Connectivity Doesn't Show Up in RDS UI:* The ‚Äúconnected compute resources‚Äù in the RDS console is not always accurate for ECS or non-EC2 clients. Don‚Äôt rely on it to debug connectivity.

### ALB
- *Target Group Unhealthy == No Traffic:* If your ECS container is running but your ALB Target Group is showing ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù targets, the ALB will not forward traffic. This is typically caused by:
    - Wrong health check path (e.g., / vs /actuator/health)
    - Port mismatch (container not listening on the expected port)
    - Network/security group misconfig
- *504 Gateway Timeout ‚â† Network Issue:* A 504 from the Load Balancer often just means the ECS container failed to start up fully or didn't bind to the correct port (e.g., 8080). Check that your application is actually listening on the port expected by the ALB Target Group.

### ECS
- *ECS Container Start = Slower Than Expected:* Don't expect ECS Fargate to start containers instantly. Between image pulling, network setup, and health checks, startup can take 1‚Äì2+ minutes.

### Secrets Manager
- *SecretsManager ‚â† Instant Fix:* Referencing secrets inside ECS task definitions must follow exact syntax (valueFrom must use the full ARN or proper SecretsManager parameter name). Mismatched names will cause cryptic errors.

### Terraform
- *Security Group Deletion Blocked:* Terraform cannot delete a security group if it's still attached to active resources (like ECS, ALB, or RDS) ‚Äî even if the plan shows successful validation. This can stall terraform destroy for several minutes.
- *Terraform Ordering Matters:* Ensure ECS services depend on RDS or networking modules (depends_on), otherwise containers may try to start before the DB is available.

# Locations API

## Overview

[Trip planner web app](https://github.com/lrasata/trip-planner-web-app) is using [Geo DB API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities)
to fetch data related to cities and countries.

To be able to deploy [Trip planner web app](https://github.com/lrasata/trip-planner-web-app)
(React + TypeScript web app) in a secure way on S3 + CloudFront, it must provide a secret `API_KEY` in the header of an authenticated request.

But the challenge is, to inject secrets securely in a React + Vite app, secrets must be separated from
the frontend and a backend must be used to access them. **There is no secure way to keep a secret in a public browser app.**

Locations API has been created to provide an API endpoint to call for the frontend without requiring any secrets. Those components provide a secure serverless API for accessing location data, powered by AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

<img src="./docs/locations-api.png" alt="location-api-diagram">

## Key attributes
**Security**
- Secrets like API keys are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and passed to Lambda via environment variables, preventing exposure in the frontend.
- No sensitive data is ever stored in the browser or client code.

**Maintainability**
- Usage of serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) to avoid managing servers, making deployments and updates easier.
- Node.js runtime and Express-style Lambda code structure to simplify development and debugging.

**Scalability**
- Lambda functions automatically scale based on incoming request volume.
- API Gateway handles request routing and can throttle.

**Reliability**
- Managed AWS services like Lambda and API Gateway provide built-in high availability.
- Error handling and CORS headers are implemented to prevent client-side failures.

**Monitoring**
- **AWS CloudWatch Alarms + SNS** are set up to monitor :
  - Api gateway :
    - Alert when API Gateway 5xx errors spike
    - Alert when API Gateway latency is high
  - Lambda function :
    - Alert when Lambda has errors

## Env variables and secret API key

**Local development**

In `lambda/handler.js`, the secret (e.g., API key) should be passed via environment variables in Terraform:

```js
Authorization: 'Bearer ${process.env.GEO_DB_RAPID_API_KEY}'
```

List of env variables :
````text
API_CITIES_GEO_DB_URL=
API_COUNTRIES_GEO_DB_URL=
GEO_DB_RAPID_API_HOST=
GEO_DB_RAPID_API_KEY=
````

**For deployed env on AWS**

Secrets have to be defined in AWS Secrets Manager inside : `prod/trip-planner-app/secrets` as configure in Terraform file.

Environment variables have to be defined in `terraform.tfvars`

## API Usage

### GET `/locations?dataType=city&namePrefix=Paris`

Query parameters :
- **dataType**: `city` or `country`
- **namePrefix**: the `string` to look up to perform matching on location name
- **countryCode**: country code

```bash
curl https://<your-api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/locations?dataType=city&namePrefix=Paris
```

## üîé Gotchas - Lessons learned (sometimes the hard way...)
- OPTIONS method should stay with *CORS headers* in API Gateway.
  - API Gateway can automatically respond to preflight OPTIONS requests (which browsers send to check permissions) without invoking your Lambda ‚Äî this reduces Lambda invocations and saves cost.
- For GET requests (or any non-OPTIONS request), Lambda function MUST return the CORS headers.
- No need to set CORS headers on API Gateway for GET/POST when using `Lambda proxy integration`.
  - But ensure your Lambda function handles CORS headers for all responses (including errors).

> üí° Let API Gateway manage CORS whenever possible - Keep Lambda code simpler and focused on business logic.
> 
> API Gateway is designed to handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings centrally.


# Frontend - Trip planner web app

## Overview
This part of the infrastructure sets up an AWS **CloudFront distribution** to serve a **Single Page Application (SPA)** from an **S3 bucket**, using **Lambda@Edge** to handle routing for client-side routes. It ensures that all SPA routes return `index.html` while keeping the S3 bucket secure and private.

<img src="docs/frontend-diagram.png" alt="trip-planner-frontend-infra">

## Key Attributes
**Security**
- S3 bucket blocks all public access.
- CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) ensures only CloudFront can access the S3 bucket.
- Lambda@Edge uses minimal IAM permissions via `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`.
- Custom header : `X-Custom-Auth`is injected by CloudFront to securely communicate with `LocationsAPI`.

**Maintainability**
- Lambda@Edge centralizes route handling for SPA, reducing manual S3 configuration.
- Versioning enabled on S3 allows easy rollback of static assets.

**Scalability**
- **CloudFront CDN** caches content globally, reducing latency and improving user experience.
- Static content served from S3 scales automatically with traffic.
- Lambda@Edge executes at edge locations, distributing the load worldwide.

**Reliability**
- CloudFront + S3 + Lambda@Edge provides high availability and low downtime.
- HTTPS is enabled with ACM certificates, ensuring secure and reliable access.

**Monitoring**
- **AWS CloudWatch Alarms + SNS** are set up to monitor :
  - Cloudfront distribution :
    - Alert when CloudFront has too many 5xx errors
  
## üîé Gotcha - Notes
- Build the frontend with `npm run build` and sync the `./dist` folder to S3 before deployment.
- Lambda@Edge must be deployed in `us-east-1`, the only region supporting it.
- ACM certificates for HTTPS for CloudFront must also be requested in `us-east-1`.
- SPA must use the CloudFront URL as the API endpoint to allow CloudFront to inject the required custom header for API Gateway:
  - Correct: `VITE_API_LOCATIONS=https://epic-trip-planner.com/locations`
  - Incorrect: `VITE_API_LOCATIONS=https://api-locations.epic-trip-planner.com/locations` - hitting the API Gateway directly will not work as it does not inject the custom header required by the API Gateway.
